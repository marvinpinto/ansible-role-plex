Ansible Galaxy role to install and manage [Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/).


Requirements
------------

This role has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and will likely only work on an
Ubuntu-like system.


Role Variables
--------------

``` yaml
# Application config
#
# Note that if you intend on using these directories, you will need to manually
# point to them from within your plex (GUI) config.
plex_app_transcode_directory: '/opt/plex_transcode'
plex_app_library_directory: '/opt/plex_library'
```


Examples
--------

Install this module from Ansible Galaxy into the './roles' directory:
```bash
ansible-galaxy install marvinpinto.plex -p ./roles
```

Use it in a playbook as follows:
```yaml
- hosts: '127.0.0.1'
  roles:
    - { role: marvinpinto.plex, become: true, tags: ["plex"] }
```

When re-running the playbook to upgrade versions of plex, run only the plex portion of the playbook with `ansible-playbook playbook.yml -t plex`

Development
-----------
Use the supplied `Vagrantfile` for local development and testing (hint: `vagrant up --provision`)
